Description: This package includes Rcpp version of the point estimation (based on order statistics) of the two parameters of a Cauchy distribution if the two parameters are unknown. It also includes R version of the point estimation and the interval estimation (based on inverse moment interval estimation) of the positional and scale parameters of a Cauchy distribution if the other parameter is unknown.
